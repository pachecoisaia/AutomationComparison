# Instructions:

The goal of this script is to make a simple comparison script that can run automated at a time specified. The idea is to have an output CSV that contains the Household ID and the Most Recent Date of a Voicemail successfully reaching the contact's Answering machine. And then once that works I want it to run as an automated script.

Please seperate the final project into 2 distinct scripts.

* The first which performs the task as described above.
* The second which performs the task but with  automation.

## Other Considerations:

* If the number is disconnected then the script should, initially, generate a Disconnected file in a seperate folder, and if the file already exists append the new results to it. 
* The file selection for the initial file and the comparison file needs to be done through some form of GUI
* The GUI should allow for the file to be renamed. (Please define a good default.)
* Build the script under the assumption that other Phone sheets may be used for comparison. (Hint: the headers will always be Household ID and some variation of a Phone Field)
* The second script should have the a GUI window that allows for adjustment of the Automation.
* The second script should also allow for a notification to be turned on to alert of the script being Completed.
* The second script should not run headless.
* Please follow best practices for structuring this Python Project
* You can use whatever libraries you'd like
* Please use well notated code and include a Jupiter file.
* I will answer 3 questions relevant to the project. (Think lifelines from Who Wants to be a Millionare)

### System Run Requirements:

* Windows 8 or 10
* x86 32-bit CPU (Intel)
* 4GB RAM
* 5GB available disk space

Remember the ultimate goal of this script is to allow for someone with little to no technical knowledge to be able to interact with and recieve the output.

When you have completed the project please zip all relevant files and send them to me at tommy.maxwell@retiregroup.com.  If the files end up being too big for email let me know and I will generate a quick way for you to get them to me.

Good Luck and let me know if you have any questions.
